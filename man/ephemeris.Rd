\usage{
ephemeris(
  name = "p:Sun",
  longitude = 0,
  latitude = 0,
  t0 = Sys.Date(),

\arguments{
\item{name}{character value of object in question. There are many objects
that can be checked, e.g. \code{"p:Sun"} for the sun and
\code{"s:Moon"} for the moon.  Default: \code{"p:Sun"}.}

\item{longitude}{decimal value of the longitude. Default: 0.}

\item{latitude}{decimal value of the latitude.  Default: 0.}

\item{t0}{POSIXct time (UTC) for the first retrieval, or a string from which
\code{\link[=as.POSIXct]{as.POSIXct()}} can infer such a time. Default: start of present day.
In Reference 1, this is called \code{ep} and referred to as the requested epoch.}

\item{nbd}{integer value of the number of times to be retrieved. Default: 5.}

\item{step}{numeric value for the time increment, in days.  Default: 1.}

\item{theory}{character value indicating the planetary theory, with choices
\code{"INPOP"}, \code{"DE200"}, \code{"BDL82"}, \code{"SLP98"}, \code{"DE403"},
\code{"DE405"}, \code{"DE406"}, \code{"DE430"}, and \code{"DE431"}. Default: \code{"INPOP"}.}

\item{teph}{integer value for the type of ephemeris, with 1
for astrometric J2000, 2 for apparent of the date, 3 for mean
of the date, or 4 for mean J2000. Default: 1.}

\item{tcoor}{integer value for the type of coordinate, with 1
for spherical, 2 for rectangular, 3 for local, 4 for hour angle, and
5 dedicated to observation. Default: 1.}

\item{rplane}{integer value for the reference plane, with 1
for equator and 2 for ecliptic. Default: 1.}

\item{debug}{logical value indicating whether to perform some
extra checks, and report on progress. Default: \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\code{ephemeris} returns a data frame with columns that depend
on the particular call.  The default call has columns named
\code{Date}, \code{RA}, \code{DEC}, \code{Dobs}, \code{VMag}, \code{dRAcosDEC},
\code{dDEC} and \code{RV}, which are shortened
versions of the names returned by the query, along with
three constructed columns, named \code{time}
(a POSIXt object based on \code{Date}),
\code{RAdec} (a decimal version of \code{RA}) and \code{DECdec} (a decimal version of
\code{DEC}).  Other calls have different results.

\description{
This function infers ephemeris data by querying a website (reference 1),
and so it requires a web connection to work. It is aimed at people who
already know the ideas and terminology of ephemeris computations.
}
\details{
The names of parameters, and their explanations, are patterned
on Reference 1. It is not easy to guess these things.  For example,
the moon is \code{"s:Moon"} (where the \code{s} indicates a satellite)
a planet).

Apart from the listed parameters of this function, the other specifications for
the query are set up in the same way as is used in the query-generation examples
provided in Reference 1.
For example, the 'observer' is set to \verb{@500}, designating the centre of the earth.

Users who are curious about the query should specify \code{debug=TRUE} when calling
this function, and they are encouraged to contact the package author, if
they would like any of these hard-wired defaults to be transformed
into a user-adjustable value, via the creation of new parameters
to this function.
